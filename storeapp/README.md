# StoreApp

Sample app that does nothing but to show Dagger 2 usage for a talks I gave at several meetups. Showcases:
* Basic Dagger 2 setup
* Scopes
* Component dependencies and Subcomponents (in earlier commits)
* dagger-android
* Testing with dagger-android
* Map and Set bindings
* Bindings and their optimizations with static binding, `@Binds` and `@BindInstance`  
* Memory sensitive scopes
